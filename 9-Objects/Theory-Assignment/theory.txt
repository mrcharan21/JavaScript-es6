Question 1: What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays?
Answer: Object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or Symbol) and the value can be any data type, including other objects, functions, or primitive values.

How are objects different from arrays?
In JavaScript, objects are used to store key-value pairs, where each value is accessed using a named key.
On the other hand, arrays are used to store ordered lists of values, accessed using numeric indexes.

Objects are best for structured data like user profiles, while arrays are best for lists or sequences like a list of fruits or numbers.

let person = { name: "Charan", age: 23 };  // Object
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"]; // Array


Question 2: Explain how to access and update object properties using dot notation and bracket notation.
Answer: In JavaScript, object properties can be accessed and updated using either dot notation or bracket notation.

Dot Notation:
You can access or update object properties using the dot operator (.) followed by the property name.
Example:

person.name; // Accessing the name property
person.age = 30; // Updating the age property


Bracket Notation:
You can also access or update object properties using bracket notation, which is useful when the property name is dynamic or not a valid identifier.
Example:

person["name"]; // Accessing the name property
person["age"] = 30; // Updating the age property
