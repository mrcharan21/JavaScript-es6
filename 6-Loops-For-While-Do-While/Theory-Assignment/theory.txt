Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide abasic example of each.
answer: In JavaScript, there are three primary types of loops used for iteration: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

1. for loop:
A for loop runs when the condition is true and is usually used when we know the exact number of times we want to loop.
It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. while loop: A while loop also runs when the condition is true, but it's used when we donâ€™t know how many times the loop should run. It checks the condition before each execution.

Example:

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}


3. do-while loop: The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

Example:

let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);




Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop? 
Answer: The main difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is when the condition is checked:

In a while loop, the condition is checked before the code runs, so it may not run at all.


In a do-while loop, the code runs at least once because the condition is checked after execution.
