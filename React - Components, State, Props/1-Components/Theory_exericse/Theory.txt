Question 1: What are components in React? Explain the difference between functional components and class components. 
Answer:In React, a component is a resuable and independent piece if code that represents a part of the UI.
Components help break down the UI into smaller,manageable pieces.
Each component can have its own logic,data (state),and presentation(JSX).


types of components in React.
1.Functional components
2.Class Components

1.Functional components

a)These are Javascript functions that return JSX.
b)They are simpler and cleaner 
c)With React Hooks, functional components can also manage state and side effects.
d)No need to use this keyword.

example: function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello ,{props.name}</h1>
}

ex2:
const Welcome = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;


2.Class Components
a)These use ES6 class syntax
b)They extend from React.component
c)Can manage state,use life cycle methods and more
d)Require this keyword to access props and states

example:
class Welcome extends React.component {
    render() {
        return <h2>Hello, {this.props.name}</h2>
    }
}



Question 2: How do you pass data to a component using props? 
Answer:
In React, you pass data to a component using props (short for "properties"). Props are custom attributes that you add to a component when you use it. The receiving component can then access these values via its props object.

Example:
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

<Welcome name="Charan" />

In this example, "name" is a prop passed to the Welcome component, and its value ("Charan") is accessed inside the component using props.name.



Question 3: What is the role of render() in class components? 
Answer:In React class componets, the render() method is required and plays a central role.
It is used to describe what the UI should look like

Main Role of render() method
-It returns JSX,Which React uses to create the UI elements
-React calls this method every time the component needs to update or re-render.
such as 
-When props or state change.
-When the component is first mounted.
