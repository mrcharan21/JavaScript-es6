1.What is React.js? How is it different from other javascript framework and libraries?
Answer: React.js is a javascript library which is used to build, dynamic user interfaces especially for creating  singel page applications.
Unlike frameworks like Angular and Vue,React focuses only on the view layer and uses a virtual DOM for better perfomance.
It follow a component based and declarative approach.



2.Explain the core principles of React such as the virtal DOM and component-based architecture.
Answer:
DOM(DocumentObjectModel)
a)virtal DOM:The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM stored in memory. When changes occur in a React application (like updating text or clicking a button), React first updates the Virtual DOM.
We use virtual dom because it has a Faster perfomance, Efficient updates and Smooth user experience.

b)Component-Based Architecture:
React applications are built using components. A component is a small, reusable piece of code that represents a part of the UI, like a button, form, or header.
Components can be reused, nested inside other components, and managed independently, which helps in building scalable and maintainable applications.
Benefits :
Reusability of code
Easy to manange and test
Clean and modular structure


Question 3: What are the advantages of using React.js in web development? 
Answer: React.js widely used in modern development due to its flexibility, perfomance and developer friendly because 
there are some major keypoints in react 
Reusable components --> Faster development
virtual DOM -->High perfomance
one-way data flow --> Easier debugging
JSX--> We writr HTML in javascript
Strong ecosystem --> Many tools and libraries
