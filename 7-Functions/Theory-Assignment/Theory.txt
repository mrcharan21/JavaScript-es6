Question 1: What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a function. 
Answer:Function is a keyword to declare the function, 
Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs (values).Instead of repeating code, we can define a function once and call it multiple times.

The syntax for declaring a function:

function functionName(parameters) {
    // code to be executed
}

Explain the syntax for calling a function:

function : function is a keyword to declare the function.
functionName : functionName is the name of the function.
parameters : optional values you can pass to the function.
{} - block of code that runs when the function is called.

Example: 

<script>
    function greet(name) {
        console.log("Hello" + name );
    }
</script>


Question 2: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression? 
Answer: The main difference between a function declaration and a function expression in JavaScript is how they are defined and used.

Function Declaration:
A function declaration is defined using the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. It is hoisted, meaning it can be called before it is defined in the code.

Function Expression:
A function expression is defined when a function is assigned to a variable. It is not hoisted, so it can only be called after it is defined in the code.


Question 3: Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions. 
Answer: Parameters are variables listed inside the parentheses in a function declaration. They act as placeholders for values that will be passed to the function when it is called.
example:

<script>
    function greet(name){
        console.log("Hello " + name);
    }
</script>

Return values is the output that a function gives back after it finishes executing.You can use the `return` keyword to send a value from the function back to where it was called.

example: 
<script>
    function add(a ,b){
        return a + b;
    }
    let result = add(10,5);
    console.log(result);
</script>

conclusion:
Parameters allow you to send input into a function.
Return values allow you to get output back from a function.

Together, they make functions powerful and dynamic, helping you avoid writing the same code again and again.
