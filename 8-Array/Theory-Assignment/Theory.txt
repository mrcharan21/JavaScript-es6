Question 1: What is an array in JavaScript? How do you declare and initialize an array? 
Answer: An array is a simple variable that we can use to store multiple data in a single variable.
It is a a collection of items that can be of any type,
including numbers,strings,objects,functions and even other arrays.
It is a data structure that allows us to store and manipulate a list of values.
Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0.
Arrays are mutable, meaning we can change their contents after they are created.


How to declare and initialize an array:
1. Using Square Brackets:
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

2. Using the Array Constructor:
let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

3. Empty Array:
let emptyArray = [];

4. Array with Mixed Types:
let mixedArray = [1, 'two', true, { key: 'value' }, [1, 2, 3]];


Question 2: Explain the methods push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() used in arrays. 
Answer: These methods are used to manipulate arrays in JavaScript:
push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.
shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.
unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
