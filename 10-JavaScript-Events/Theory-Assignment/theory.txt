Question 1: What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners.
Answer:
JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, which JavaScript can respond to.
Examples of events :
A use clicking a button(click)
A web page loading (load)
A user pressing a key (keydown)
A form being submitted (submit)
A mouse moving over an element (mouseover)


Role of event listeners:
A method that listens for an event and runs a function when that event occurs.
An event listener is a function that waits for an event to occur on a specified element element and then executes code in response to that event.

syntax:
element.addEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction);



//Question 2: How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript? Provide an example. 
Answer:
The addEventListener() method in JavaScript is used to attach an event listener to a specified element. This method allows you to listen for a specific event (like a click, keypress, etc.) and execute a callback function when that event occurs.
The syntax for addEventListener() is as follows:
```javascript
element.addEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction);
```
Where:
- `element` is the DOM element you want to attach the event listener to.
- `eventType` is a string representing the type of event to listen for (e.g., 'click', 'keydown').
- `callbackFunction` is the function that will be executed when the event occurs.
Example:

 <script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
            const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
            button.addEventListener('click', function() {
                alert('Button was clicked!');
            });
        });
    </script>
